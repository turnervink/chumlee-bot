# Chumlee Bot Terms of Service

This bot is provided as-is with no guarantees of quality, availability, or security.
It is provided to you for free, for fun, and since I'm hosting it myself I reserve the right
to take it offline or make it non-public at any time without prior notice.

I don't know how you'd manage to, but if I find out you're using Chumlee Bot for
harmful things you won't be allowed to use it any more.

Please feel free to get in touch if you notice any issues, or have ideas for improvements.
I may not be able to get back to you quickly or at all, and I may not be able to implement fixes or
features, but I do love to hear from people using stuff I've created!

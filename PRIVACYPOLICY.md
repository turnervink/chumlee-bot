# Chumlee Bot Privacy Policy

If you add this bot to your Discord server the following data will be collected and stored:
- The ID and name of your Discord server
- The Discord member IDs of any users that interact with the bot in your server
- The IDs of any channels within your Discord server

All of this data is stored in a Google Firebase database and used to help the bot operate properly.
E.g. Discord member IDs are used to store each users' Chumcoin balance and medals information, and server and channel
IDs are used to track what channels the bot has been allowed to message in in each server.

The bot logs any errors that occur when users are interacting with it in order to help
find issues and further improve the project. These logs are stored on the server where the bot is hosted.
They will usually include the information specified above, such as member and server IDs.
